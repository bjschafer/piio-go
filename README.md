PIIO-go
-------

In progress...

## Building
Run the following commands:

`export GOOS=linux`

`export GOARCH=arm`

`go build`

The resulting binary has been cross-compiled and will run directly on a Raspberry Pi.  You can just copy it over by your favorite means (e.g. scp) and run it.  No guarantees it works!
